PictureIt - Kodi Visualization
==============================

[![Linux Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/linuxwhatelse/visualization.pictureit.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/linuxwhatelse/visualization.pictureit)

PictureIt is supposed to make listening to music more elegant and less flashy.<br>
The idea is to take random images YOU selected and display them alongside a simple spectrum at the bottom.<br>
Simple right?

## Features
 * Select a local directory containing your images (If sub-folders are present, those will be used as "Preset")
 * Update images by interval
 * Update images on new track
 * Change the transition time
 * Enable/Disable the spectrum
 * Enable/Disable a settle spectrum-background
 * Change the spectrums: Width, Bottom-Padding, Animation-Speed

## Installation
 1. Install the [linuxwhatelse repository](http://linuxwhatelse.de/projects/kodi/repo/repository.linuxwhatelse.zip)
 2. Install PictureIt
 3. In the add-on configuration set the path to a directory holding your images/wallpapers
 4. Done!

## ToDo
 * Rework the spectrum.<br>
As of now it looks quite busy and doesn't match the music very well.<br>
